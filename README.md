# <strong><u> Organise Script <u><strong>

## Project Description
My organise script is a bash utility that allows users to sort files within a specified directory into categorized folders based on the file types.

This script was orgiginally made to organise my downloads, however, I extended the functionality to work with any directory. This script was designed to improve file management efficency

## <u> Features <u>

- Creates folders for differeing file types i.e, Documents, Images, Videos etc
- Automatically moves these files into respective folders based on their <strong> file extensions<strong>
- Flexible File Name inputs: My script allows for <strong> any possible <strong> folder name for the folder
- My Script allows for files to be moved to their designated folders based on their extensions, ensuring a <strong> Well Organised directory <strong>
- My script works on <strong> ANY DIRECTORY <strong>
- My script also has <strong> Good error handling <strong> as it checks for invalid inputs and scenarios where folders or files do not exist

## <strong><u> Usage <u><strong>
1) Download the organise script file or Clone the repository 

2) <strong> Make the script executable<strong>
```bash
    chmod +x organise.sh
```
3) <strong> run the script <strong>
```bash
./organise.sh
```
Or
``` bash
sh organise.sh
```

4) <strong> Follow prompts and input directory you want to sort, and folder types followed by folder names <strong>
